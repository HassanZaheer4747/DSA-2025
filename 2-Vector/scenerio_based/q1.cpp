// Youâ€™re working on a logistics system for a warehouse. The system keeps track of packages that are ready to be delivered. Each package has a priority level (integer) stored in a vector<int>.
// ðŸŽ¯ Your tasks:
// Input the priority levels of n packages.
// Remove all packages with priority 0 (these were cancelled).
// Sort the remaining packages by priority in descending order (highest priority first).
// Find and print the second highest priority package.
// Print the updated list of packages.
